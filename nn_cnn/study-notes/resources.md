Although signs are available as video sequences in the training set, temporal information is not in the test set. The present project aims to build a robust recognizer without temporal evidence accumulation.
Each stage is composed of a (convolutional) filter bank layer, a non-linear transform layer, and a spatial feature pooling layer. The spatial pooling layers lower the spatial resolution of the representation, thereby making the representation robust to small shifts and geometric distortions, similarly to “complex cells” in standard models of the visual cortex.
