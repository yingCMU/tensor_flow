# increase accuracy
There are various aspects to consider when thinking about this problem:

1. Neural network architecture (is the network over or underfitting?)
2. Play around preprocessing techniques (normalization, rgb to grayscale, etc)
    why?
3. Number of examples per label (some have more than others).
4. Generate fake data.
