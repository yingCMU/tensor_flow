Despite this encouraging progress, there is still little insight into the internal
operation and behavior of these complex models, or how they achieve such good
performance. From a scientific standpoint, this is deeply unsatisfactory. Without clear understanding of how and why they work, the development of better models is reduced to trial-and-error.
