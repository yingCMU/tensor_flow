##  backprop
1. each backprop step takes 2X memory as forwardprop, why?
2. make hidden layer wider vs make deeper layer
  1. you can get much more performance using less parameters by going deeper rather than wider
  2.lots of phenomena tend to have a hierarchical structure, as a result, the model has easier time learning then.  e.g image processing line edges->part shapes -> objects
